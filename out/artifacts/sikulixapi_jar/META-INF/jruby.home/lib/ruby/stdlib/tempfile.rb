# JRuby 1.7.x and lower implements most of tempfile as a JRuby ext. This
# file simple loads that ext and then adds the additional functions that

# Creates a temporally file as usual File object (not Tempfile).
# It don't use finalizer and delegation.
#
# If no block is given, this is similar to Tempfile.new except
# creating File instead of Tempfile.
# The created file is not removed automatically.
# You should use File.unlink to remove it.
#
# If a block is given, then a File object will be constructed,
# and the block is invoked with the object as the argument.
# The File object will be automatically closed and
# the temporally file is removed after the block terminates.
# The call returns the value of the block.
#
# In any case, all arguments (+*args+) will be treated as Tempfile.new.

#   Tempfile.create('foo', '/home/temp') do |f|
#      ... do something with f ...
